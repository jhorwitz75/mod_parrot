This is a PHP implementation of "Polly" from the Perl 6 examples.  It uses
the Pipp compiler included with the Parrot distribution.  Place it in your
document root and configure as follows:

ParrotLibPath /path/to/parrot/runtime/library:/path/to/mod_parrot/lib
ParrotLoadImmediate ModParrot/HLL/pipp.pbc
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

You will also want to set the PARROT_RUNTIME environment variable to your
parrot build directory before starting Apache.  You can do this on the command
line or in Apache's envvars script (found in the same directory as apachectl).
