This directory contains example mod_perl6 handlers.

How to use mod_perl6:

1) In the top level directory, type "make modperl6" to precompile mod_perl6.
   This is not required, but it does provide a 10x improvement in startup time.
3) In the Apache's envvars script:
   a) set PERL6LIB to the absolute path to languages/perl6/lib, or add it to
      the path (colon-separated) if PERL6LIB is already set.
   b) Add any local Perl 6 include paths where your handler modules will live.
   c) Set PARROT_RUNTIME to your parrot source directory.
4) Configure your handlers in httpd.conf (the examples contain instructions)
5) Restart Apache (do a full stop and start if you updated envvars).
