OVERVIEW
--------
mod_parrot embeds the Parrot virtual machine in the Apache 2 web server,
allowing you to write handlers in Parrot or any language targeted to the
Parrot VM.

STATUS
------
mod_parrot is slowly maturing.  While its design is stable now, it should
still be considered pre-alpha, as anything could change at any time.

There are no plans to backport it to Apache 1.3.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
* Apache 2.0.x or 2.2.x (2.4 may work but is untested)
* A recent subversion checkout of Parrot (r35084 or later)
* Perl 5.8.0 or later for configuration
* Apache::Test 1.26 or later (for tests)

INSTALLATION
------------
To configure, compile, test and install:

1) perl Configure.pl --parrot-build-dir=/path/to/parrot --apxs=/path/to/apxs
2) make
3) make test
4) make install (as root, if appropriate)

CONFIGURING APACHE
------------------
NOTE: This is a very basic configuration for a PIR response handler, and is
only meant as an example.  In addition to this README, please see the
documentation for the HLL module(s) you are interested in using.

1) Verify mod_parrot is activated in httpd.conf:

   LoadModule parrot_module      modules/mod_parrot.so

2) Tell Apache how to initialize mod_parrot using ParrotInit:

   ParrotInit /path/to/mod_parrot/lib/mod_parrot.pbc

   Alternatively you can copy mod_parrot.pbc to parrot's runtime directory
   and set the PARROT_RUNTIME environment variable to that directory.
   mod_parrot will then be able to find this file automatically.

3) Tell mod_parrot where to find its libraries:

   ParrotLibPath /path/to/mod_parrot/lib

4) Load the PIR HLL layer:

   ParrotLoadImmediate ModParrot/HLL/pir.pbc

5) Load your Parrot handler with ParrotLoad.  It can be PIR or compiled PBC.

   ParrotLoad /path/to/your/code

6) Configure a location and set the handler to "parrot-code", the official
   mod_parrot handler string.  Use ParrotHandler to tell mod_parrot what to
   run for the content handler by passing it the namespace you used in your
   code:

   <Location /parrot/squawk>
       SetHandler parrot-code
       ParrotHandler MyApp
   </Location>

   Or use one or more of the other Parrot*Handlers.

6) Restart Apache.

7) Go to the URL you configured and try out your new handler.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
The "docs" directory contains most of the documentation.  Most of it is
focused on the design of mod_parrot rather than usage.  Additional POD
documentation can be found in various PIR files in the lib directory.
